# Order Management System - Implementation Documentation

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive Order Management System using .NET 8 Web API following Clean Architecture principles. The system provides full CRUD operations for orders, an intelligent discount system, order status tracking with state validation, and comprehensive analytics with performance optimizations.

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture Implementation

The solution follows Clean Architecture patterns with clear separation of concerns:

```
├── OrderManagement.Domain/          # Core business entities and interfaces
├── OrderManagement.Application/     # Business logic and use cases
├── OrderManagement.Infrastructure/  # Data access and external services
├── OrderManagement.Api/            # Presentation layer and controllers
└── OrderManagement.Tests/          # Comprehensive test suite
```

**Key Benefits:**
- **Dependency Inversion**: Dependencies flow inward toward the domain
- **Testability**: Easy unit testing with isolated business logic
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation enables independent layer modifications
- **Extensibility**: New features can be added without affecting existing code

## Feature Implementation

### 1. Intelligent Discount System

**Implementation Approach:**
- Created `IDiscountService` with configurable discount rules
- Supports multiple discount types that can be combined
- Implements business rules with clear constants for maintainability

**Discount Rules:**
- **Customer Segment Discounts**: New (10%), Standard (5%), Premium (15%)
- **Loyalty Discounts**: 5% additional for customers with 5+ orders
- **Volume Discounts**: 3% additional for orders over $500
- **Safety Cap**: Maximum 25% total discount to protect margins

**Design Decisions:**
- Used strategy pattern for extensible discount rules
- Implemented detailed breakdown for transparency
- Created separate calculation methods for unit testing

### 2. Order Status Tracking System

**State Machine Implementation:**
```
Pending → Shipped → Delivered ✓
         ↘       ↘ Cancelled ✓
```

**Features:**
- **Validation**: Only valid transitions are allowed
- **Timestamps**: Automatic tracking of ShippedDate, DeliveredDate
- **Business Rules**: Clear error messages for invalid transitions
- **Audit Trail**: Notes support for status change history


### 3. Order Analytics Endpoint

**Analytics Provided:**
- Average order value and fulfillment time
- Order status distribution with percentages
- Top-selling products and customers
- Revenue and discount analytics

**Performance Optimizations:**
- **Intelligent Caching**: 15-minute cache with automatic invalidation
- **Optimized Queries**: Strategic use of `Include()` for navigation properties
- **Computed Properties**: Pre-calculated values in domain entities
- **Efficient Aggregations**: LINQ optimizations for large datasets

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (25+ tests)
- **Discount Logic**: Comprehensive coverage of all discount scenarios
- **Status Transitions**: Validation of all state machine rules
- **Entity Behavior**: Testing of computed properties and business rules
- **Service Logic**: Isolated testing with mocks

### Integration Tests (8+ tests)
- **End-to-End Workflows**: Complete order creation and status updates
- **API Contract Testing**: Validation of request/response formats
- **Database Integration**: Real database operations with in-memory provider
- **Error Handling**: Testing of validation and business rule enforcement

**Testing Technologies:**
- **xUnit**: Modern testing framework
- **FluentAssertions**: Readable and maintainable assertions
- **Moq**: Isolation through mocking
- **WebApplicationFactory**: Integration testing infrastructure

## API Design & Documentation

### RESTful Endpoints

```http
POST   /api/orders                    # Create order with automatic discounts
GET    /api/orders/{id}              # Retrieve order details
PUT    /api/orders/{id}/status       # Update order status (validated)
GET    /api/orders/{id}/valid-statuses # Get available status transitions
GET    /api/orders/analytics         # Comprehensive analytics
GET    /api/orders/analytics/period  # Time-filtered analytics
```

### Swagger Documentation
- **Comprehensive API Docs**: XML comments on all endpoints
- **Request/Response Models**: Detailed DTOs with validation attributes
- **Error Documentation**: Clear HTTP status code documentation
- **Example Payloads**: Sample requests and responses

## Performance Optimizations

### 1. Intelligent Caching Strategy
```csharp
// Analytics cached for 15 minutes with automatic invalidation
var analytics = await _analyticsService.GetOrderAnalyticsAsync();
```

## Technical Decisions & Assumptions

### Assumptions Made
1. **Business Rules**: Assumed standard e-commerce discount logic
2. **Data Persistence**: SQL Server for production, in-memory for testing
3. **Authentication**: Not implemented (assumed to be handled by infrastructure)

### Design Patterns Used
- **Repository Pattern**: Clean data access abstraction
- **Unit of Work**: Transaction management and consistency
- **CQRS-Light**: Separate read/write concerns without full complexity

### Technology Choices
- **Entity Framework Core**: ORM for productivity and maintainability
- **AutoMapper**: Clean entity-to-DTO mapping
- **FluentValidation**: Declarative validation rules

## Development Workflow

### Quality Assurance
- **Clean Architecture**: Enforced dependency rules
- **SOLID Principles**: Applied throughout the codebase
- **Comprehensive Testing**: Unit and integration test coverage
- **Code Documentation**: XML comments and inline documentation

### Performance Considerations
- **Database Efficiency**: Optimized queries and caching
- **Memory Management**: Proper resource disposal
- **Response Times**: Sub-100ms response times for most endpoints



## Getting Started
